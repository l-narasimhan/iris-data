# Submitting Changes
 Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes. Bigger changes should have a brief explaining paragraph. It can look like this:

 ```diff
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
>
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```
